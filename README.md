# FAA Construction Crane Viewer

An entirely vibe-coded web application that displays construction cranes within a 10 nautical mile radius of a specified location, using the FAA's [Daily Digital Object File](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dailydof/).

See [demo page](https://jeffreyp.github.io/faa-crane-viewer). The data used for this website is refreshed daily at 06:00 UTC. The update process is documented [here](https://github.com/jeffreyp/faa-crane-viewer/blob/main/scripts/README.md).

## Features

- Search for construction cranes near a specific address 
- Adjust the search radius (in nautical miles)
- View cranes on an interactive map
- See crane details in a sortable table view

## Running the Application

### Local Development

To run the application locally for development:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create optimized files in the `public` directory.

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages:

1. Update the `homepage` field in `package.json` with your GitHub username:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/faa-crane-viewer"
   ```

2. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. The application will be available at the URL specified in your homepage field

## Implementation Details

This application is built with:

- React for the user interface
- Leaflet for the interactive map
- CartoDB Voyager tiles for the map display
- Webpack for bundling
- Data from the FAA Daily Digital Object File (DOF)

**Important**: The app uses React and loads from `bundle.js` (generated by webpack), not the old `app.js` file.
